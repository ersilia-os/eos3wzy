# Predict micro-pKa of organic molecules

QupKake is an innovative approach that combines graph neural network (GNN) models with semiempirical quantum mechanical (QM) features to forecast the micro-pKa values of organic molecules. QM has a significant role in both identifying reaction sites and predicting micro-pKa values. Precisely predicting micro-pKa values is vital for comprehending and adjusting the acidity and basicity of organic compounds, This has significant applications in drug discovery, materials science, and environmental chemistry.
